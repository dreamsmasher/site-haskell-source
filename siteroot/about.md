title: About
---

My name is Norman Liu, and I'm a dev from Vancouver. I graduated with a B.Sc.in Biology, but realized later on that my real passion was code. In my spare time, I'm usually exploring open-source projects, playing music, or grinding through LeetCode questions (currently at 650-something).

I love problem solving, mathematics, and programming. I'm drawn to the creativity and unconventional thinking that programming requires, and the ability to build and design a system by myself. There's a ton of beauty in code, and I like to express that when it might not be immediately obvious. 

I mainly write my personal projects in Haskell, and I graduated from Hack Reactor as a full-stack developer. I figure there's more work for `TypeScript` developers than at the few dozen companies that use sane languages. This blog is a way for me to try and get over my aversion to CSS, and showcase my skills.

The format I'm following is that of the [long site](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site), which basically saves me the stress of having to edit to perfection before publishing. My writing cycle is that I come up with ideas, vomit everything into a neat little .md file, and publish. Then I come back to it the next day. And the next day. And so on, until I feel like there aren't any more improvements I can make for the time being. If I make any typos or egregious errors in my writing, however, please let me know. Everything you need to [Contact](https://nliu.net/contact.html) me is five words back.

All my posts are written using [neovim](https://neovim.io/), and I use [coc-markdownlint](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-markdownlint) for error-checking. The site is generated using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a static site generator written and configured in Haskell. I build and deploy using CircleCI, which is arguably overkill, there's a certain sense of power that comes with provisioning a VM just to generate 100kb of HTML. It's like having an army of machines available to do your web-developer bidding.

It saves me 8 lines of typing each update, though. :)
