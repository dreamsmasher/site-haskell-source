The previous few days of [Advent](https://adventofcode.com) have been kinda boring - day 4 was regex, then binary search, then set intersections. We're finally back to graph traversals, and so I felt like this was worth a post.

The problem goes as follows - you've sledded to the airport, made it past security, boarded your plane, and gotten through customs. Now that you're out of the North Pole and at your layover, bizarre baggage rules are only the next obstacle on your trip.

Specifically, bags must be colour-coded and must contain [specific quantities of other colour-coded bags](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7). The input consists of several hundred lines that each describe the colour of a bag, and its required contents, like

```haskell
shiny red bags contain 5 muted pink bags, 1 faded green bag.
faded green bags contain no other bags.
bright white bags contain 2 muted black bags.
```

That's a ton of nested bags, and it's starting to sound like a graph theory problem. We can label each node by its colour description, and its edges by the bags that it has to contain. Since logically, a bag can't contain itself, and inner bags can't contain outer bags (forming a cycle), we can look at this as a [directed acyclic graph](https://nliu.net/posts/2020-10-30-tsort.html).

Sounds simple enough. We'll conjure up some Haskell as usual, and model our graph as a `Map` of `String`s (bag colours) to lists, `[(String, Int)]`, denoting other bag colours and their respective counts.

I took some time this weekend and refactored my [Advent of Code repo](https://github.com/dreamsmasher/advent-of-code-2020) a little bit. It makes use of the [advent-of-code-api](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/advent-of-code-api) library to automatically fetch inputs and submit solutions, saving me some time every night. I've also abstracted away a bunch of modules into one monolithic file for faster imports. All in all, I save about 30 seconds now.

```haskell
module Solutions.Day7 where

import Helpers -- Control.Arrow, Control.Applicative, Control.Monad, Data.Maybe, Data.List.Split, Data.List
```

We also need a way to map keys to values. `Data.Map` is comfy, although it uses trees instead of hash tables internally. That's fine for our purposes.
``` haskell
import Data.Map (Map, (!))
import qualified Data.Map as M

```
Following my tradition of avoiding regex like the plague, we'll spit out something naive to parse our input into the format we want. In my defense, even Parsec is an ordeal to debug and it was late.

It seems like every line has the term ` bags contain` separating the description of a bag and the description of its children, so we'll use `splitOn` from `Data.List.Split`. Only matching a 2-element list like that is dangerous in the real world, because you'll hit a parse error if you try to match a list of any other length. 

If a description says `no other`, we can (safely) assume that there won't be any outgoing edges from this graph node. It also saves us from a potential edge case when trying to parse the descriptions of inner bags. We'll focus on a single line at first.

```haskell 
parseBag :: String -> (String, [(String, Int)])
parseBag = splitOn " bags contain" >>> \[colour, inners] -> (colour, edges)
  where edges = ("no other" `isInfixOf` inners ? [] $ ((map parseDscrp . splitComma) inners)))
```

"But Haskell doesn't have ternary operators???" you say, bound by the shackles of inflexible syntax.

```haskell
(?) :: Bool -> a -> a -> a
(?) True = const
(?) False = const id

-- splitComma is also defined in helpers
splitComma :: [Char] -> [[Char]]
splitComma = splitOn ","
```

We also need to parse the predicates of each sentence. We know that each description is separated by commas, so we can break the task down to parsing a single description at a time. The inputs for `parseDscrp` will look like `<number> <adj> <color> (bag[s])` at this point. Wikipedia doesn't list any colours that start with "bag", and [Eric](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) isn't evil, so we'll filter out any "bag"-like word too.

Since every sequence starts with a number, we'll just split by words, turn the number-string into an `Int`, and use the remainder as our colour. These colours should match up with the colour descriptions that preface each line, that we'll use as keys in our eventual `Map`.

```haskell
parseDscrp :: String -> (String, Int)
parseDscrp = words >>> filter (not . ("bag" `isPrefixOf`)) >>> (tail &&& head) >>> (unwords *** read) 
                                                           -- \(n:bs) -> (unwords bs, read n)) 
```
Let's try these out now.

``` haskell
> parseDscrp "5 muted pink bags" 
(5, "muted pink")

> parseBag "bright orange bags contain 5 muted pink bags, 1 dark black bag."
("bright orange", [(5, "muted pink"), (1, "dark black")])

> parseBag "dark black bags contain no other bags."
("dark black", [])
```

Way easier than writing regular expressions, right? At least it's more fun this way. Let's build our graph now - `fromList` from `Data.Map` expects a list `[(key, value)]`, which matches up with the output type of `parseBag`. All our types match up, so we'll connect our functions into a neat little pipeline and build a dependency graph from our input.

```haskell
type Graph = Map String [(String, Int)]

fromInput :: String -> Graph
fromInput = lines >>> map parseBag >>> M.fromList
```

Part 1 seems like it's asking a lot at first. The prompt reads, "You have a **shiny gold** bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag?".

Putting that into simpler terms, it's asking how many **nodes** in our graph can reach "shiny gold". We know that each bag doesn't contain that many *different* bags, and that the result of searching for "shiny gold" in a bag's path depends on whether we find it deeper down in our traversal. In any other languages, this is a dynamic programming problem. We have a lot of inputs, a (potentially expensive) recursive call, and a ton of sharing between values. Luckily, we're working in a lazy language, and values only get computed once within a [given](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3ehysu/memoization_in_haskell/) [closure](https://jelv.is/blog/Lazy-Dynamic-Programming/). If we pass "matte beige" into `walk`, find an answer, and encounter "matte beige" again during a later traversal, the answer will be returned immediately since the results will be cached by the GHC runtime. `walk` is recursive, and we're likely to encounter the same values many times, so having implicit memoization in the background saves us a ton of effort. To be honest, getting implicit memoization to kick in is a subtle thing, but my code took less than 60ms for both parts combined so I'll count that as a win. I'll have to come back and do some profiling at a later date to get a better insight of what's going on underneath.

In the meantime, we've done it. Either a node has "shiny gold", or one of its children does. We'll traverse from every node in our graph, and count the number of successful starting points. Again, passing 3 functions into `liftA2` will apply functions 2 3 to the same input, passing both results as arguments into the first. `liftA2 f g h = \x -> f (g x) (h x)` is incredibly useful.

```haskell
walk :: Graph -> String -> Bool
walk g b = "shiny gold" `elem` kids || any (walk g) kids
    where kids = map fst $ (g ! b)

day7Pt1 :: String -> Int
day7Pt1 = fromInput >>> liftA2 filter walk (map fst . M.toList) >>> length
```

Part 2 coming soon! 

```haskell
innerBags :: Graph -> String -> Int
innerBags g b = succ (sum $ uncurry ((*) . innerBags g) <$> (g ! b))
               
day7Pt2 :: String -> Int
day7Pt2 = fromInput >>> (pred . flip innerBags "shiny gold")
    -- pred because a shiny gold bag can't contain itself
```
