title: About
---

My name is Norman Liu, and I'm a dev from Vancouver. I graduated with a B.Sc.in Biology, but realized way too late that my real passion was code. In my spare time, I'm usually exploring open-source projects, playing music, or grinding through LeetCode questions (currently at 600-something).

I love problem solving, mathematics, and programming. I'm drawn to the creativity and unconventional thinking that programming requires, and the ability to build and design a structure myself. It's way more entertaining than memorizing biochemical signaling pathways from a textbook.

I mainly write my personal projects in Haskell, but I'm attending Hack Reactor (a bootcamp based in SF) currently. I figure there's more work for `TypeScript` developers than at the few dozen companies that use Haskell. This blog is a way for me to try and get over my aversion to CSS, and showcase my skills. There's no JS, though.

The format I'm following is that of the [long site](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-site), which basically saves me the stress of having to edit to perfection before publishing. My writing cycle is that I come up with ideas, vomit everything into a neat little .md file, and publish. Then I come back to it the next day. And the next day. And so on, until I feel like there aren't any more improvements I can make for the time being. Imagine paying money for an editor. If I make any typos or egregious errors in my writing, however, please let me know. Everything you need to [Contact](https://nliu.net/contact.html) me is five words back.

All my posts are written in [neovim](https://neovim.io/), with markdown linting provided by plugins. The site is generated using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a static site generator written and configured in Haskell. Whenever I write an update or new article, I push a commit to the site's backend repository. CircleCI spins up a Linux VM, takes care of Hakyll's dependencies, builds the site, then automatically deploys it to the hosted repo. It's honestly overkill for a static website, and I'm wasting a ton of electricity by delegating this to the cloud.

It saves me 8 lines of typing for each update, though. :)
